First, you must move the data folder so that it is in the same directory as Project2. 

For all scala files, uncomment the desired optimizer to be used. 

For the python/keras files, some packages are necessary. These are: sklearn, matplotlib, and keras. Next, you can choose the desired models by setting the booleans at the top to true, and multiple models can be selected. Only one optimizer can be chosen at a time. Next, set the desired activation functions for each layer to true, and only one of these should be true per layer. Then, running the file will print out the model accuracies as well as plot the loss function per epoch.
